    <description>Hxcs is a support library for the C# backend of the haxe compiler. In this first release, all we have are stubs, but there is plan to support automatic C# code build (with .csproj generation), hxcpp/neko CFFI support and the complete .NET standard library externs.</description>
    <version name="2.10.0">Initial release, only stubs are created</version>
